Why Turnover on Downs is NOT included in Turnovers
Q: Should turnover on downs be counted as a turnover?
A: No. Turnover on downs is categorically different from interceptions and fumbles. The key distinction is whether the opponent gains an EXTRA possession:

Interception: Opponent gets an extra drive (you had 12 drives, they get 13)
Fumble lost: Same—extra possession created
Turnover on downs: No extra possession. Your drive was ending anyway; you just chose to end it at the line of scrimmage instead of 40 yards downfield via punt.

Turnover on downs is already captured by Field Position (opponent starts at the failed 4th down spot) and Finishing Drives (if inside the 40, you got 0 points for that trip). Adding it to Turnovers would double-count the field position impact while falsely implying a possession swing that didn't happen.
Turnovers should be thought of as "extra possessions lost"—which TOD doesn't trigger.

Why 8 Factors Instead of the Original 5
Q: Bill Connelly's Five Factors are widely used. Why add three more?
A: The original Five Factors (Efficiency, Explosiveness, Finishing Drives, Field Position, Turnovers) explain approximately 71-90% of variance in game outcomes. However, for a purely DESCRIPTIVE tool that explains "why did this team win THIS game," three gaps emerge:

Penalties: A team can "win" efficiency and explosiveness but have two TD-negating holding calls and a drive-extending DPI. Penalties are invisible in the original framework.
Non-Offensive Points: A pick-6 only shows as +1 in turnover margin, but it's actually worth ~10+ points of swing (7 scored + the lost possession). Defensive/ST touchdowns and safeties are under-counted.
Possessions: Two teams can have identical efficiency, but if one ran 80 plays and the other ran 55, volume explains the outcome. Possession count captures this.

Why Hidden Yards (Return Yards) Is NOT a Separate Factor
Q: Kickoff return yards and interception return yards seem important. Why aren't they tracked separately?
A: Hidden yards are already captured through their outcomes:

Return yards that result in a score → captured by Non-Offensive Points
Return yards that set up great field position → captured by Field Position
The only gap is "return yards that set up medium field position"—which is low-impact enough to ignore

Adding hidden yards as a separate factor would create overlap with Field Position and add noise without explanatory value.

Why "Non-Offensive Points" Instead of "Defensive/ST Touchdowns"
Q: Why use the broader term?
A: "Non-Offensive Points" captures all scoring events outside normal offensive flow:

Pick-6 (7 points)
Fumble return TD (7 points)
Punt return TD (7 points)
Kick return TD (7 points)
Blocked kick returned for TD (7 points)
Safety (2 points + possession change)

Calling it just "Defensive TDs" or "ST TDs" would miss safeties, which are high-impact, low-frequency events.

Why Certain Stats Are NOT Separate Factors
Q: Why not include third-down conversion rate, red zone TD percentage, or sacks?
A: These are already captured by existing factors:

Third-down rate: Largely captured by Efficiency (Success Rate)—a team with high success rate is converting third downs
Red zone TD%: Captured by Finishing Drives (Points Per Trip inside 40)
Sacks: Affect both Efficiency and Explosiveness numbers

Adding them separately would create redundancy without improving explanatory power.

Why Turnovers Are Weighted Despite Being "Random"
Q: Research shows turnovers are 55/45 skill vs luck. Why include them?
A: For PREDICTIVE purposes, turnovers are problematic—year-to-year correlation explains only 2.6% of variance. But this is a DESCRIPTIVE tool. In any single game, turnovers absolutely explain the outcome. A team that wins the turnover battle wins ~73% of games. We're not predicting future performance; we're explaining what happened.

Strength Encoding Thresholds
Q: How are "dominant," "strong," "slight," and "minimal" advantages calculated?
A: The percentage difference between the two teams' values:

Dominant: Greater than 30% difference
Strong: 15-30% difference
Slight: 5-15% difference
Minimal: Less than 5% difference

The calculation: |home - away| / ((|home| + |away|) / 2)
These thresholds were chosen to create meaningful visual distinction while avoiding over-sensitivity to small differences.
