Follow-ups:
- Add handling for current in-progress drives so live games reflect latest plays.
- Capture turnovers on downs explicitly from drive/play results.
- [DONE] Pull win-probability values from the v2 plays feed (dereference probability $ref) and show them in expanded output.
- INclude WP filter
- Add plays that explain more rows; all plays that you give the ball to the other team --> field position
