GAME ANALYSIS DASHBOARD - STAT DOCUMENTATION
============================================

This dashboard uses 8 factors to explain why one team won a football game.
Together, these factors account for approximately 95%+ of game outcomes.


CORE FIVE FACTORS (from Bill Connelly's framework)
--------------------------------------------------

1. TURNOVERS (Margin)
   
   What it measures: The difference in giveaways (interceptions + fumbles lost)
   between the two teams.
   
   How to read it: Positive = fewer giveaways than opponent. A team with "+2"
   forced two more turnovers than they committed.
   
   Why it matters: Turnovers create possession asymmetry. If you turn it over
   twice and force none, your opponent gets 2 extra drives. Teams winning the
   turnover battle win approximately 73% of games.
   
   Note: Turnover on downs is NOT included here—see FAQ for rationale.


2. YARDS PER PLAY (Efficiency)
   
   What it measures: Total yards divided by total plays. A raw efficiency metric.
   
   How to read it: Higher is better. NFL average is approximately 5.0-5.5 yards
   per play.
   
   Why it matters: Captures overall offensive firepower in a single number.
   However, this can be skewed by a few explosive plays, so it's complemented
   by Success Rate.


3. SUCCESS RATE (Play Success %)
   
   What it measures: The percentage of plays that gain "enough" yards, defined as:
   - 1st down: 50% of yards needed (5+ yards for 1st & 10)
   - 2nd down: 70% of yards needed
   - 3rd/4th down: 100% of yards needed (convert or gain first down)
   
   How to read it: Higher is better. Elite offenses exceed 45%; struggling
   offenses fall below 35%.
   
   Why it matters: This is the single most predictive stat in football analytics.
   Unlike yards per play, it's not skewed by explosives—it measures whether a
   team consistently moves the chains. A team can have modest YPP but high
   Success Rate by avoiding negative plays.


4. EXPLOSIVE PLAYS (10+ Yard Gains)
   
   What it measures: Raw count of plays gaining 10+ yards (some definitions use
   12+ for runs, 16+ for passes).
   
   How to read it: Higher is better. This is a volume metric.
   
   Why it matters: Big plays create scoring opportunities and swing momentum.
   However, explosive plays are less predictable game-to-game than efficiency.


5. EXPLOSIVE PLAY RATE (Explosiveness)
   
   What it measures: Percentage of plays that go for 10+ yards.
   
   How to read it: Higher is better. Typically ranges from 8-15% for NFL teams.
   
   Why it matters: Normalizes explosive plays for pace. A team running 80 plays
   might have more explosives than a team running 55, but the rate tells you
   which team is more dangerous per snap.


6. POINTS PER TRIP INSIDE 40 (Finishing Drives)
   
   What it measures: Average points scored when a team's drive reaches the
   opponent's 40-yard line.
   
   How to read it: Higher is better. Maximum theoretical is 7.0 (TD every trip).
   Good teams score 4.5-5.5; poor finishers fall below 3.5.
   
   Why it matters: Getting into scoring position means nothing if you settle for
   field goals or turn it over. This captures red zone efficiency plus the
   ability to convert good field position into points.


7. AVERAGE STARTING FIELD POSITION (Field Position)
   
   What it measures: The average yard line where a team begins its offensive
   drives. Expressed as "Own XX" (e.g., "Own 28").
   
   How to read it: Higher number is better. "Own 35" means starting at your 35,
   which is better than "Own 22."
   
   Why it matters: Field position compounds over a game. Starting at your 35 vs
   your 20 on every drive is a 15-yard advantage per possession. Over 12 drives,
   that's 180 hidden yards. This captures punt/kick return effectiveness,
   turnover locations, and opponent punt distance.


ADDITIONAL FACTORS (addressing gaps in original framework)
----------------------------------------------------------

8. PENALTIES (Yards)
   
   What it measures: Total penalty yards assessed against each team.
   
   How to read it: Lower is better. This is inverted from most stats.
   
   Why it matters: Penalties are invisible in efficiency stats but can be
   game-deciding. A 15-yard personal foul that extends a drive, or a holding
   call that negates a touchdown, directly impacts scoring in ways no other
   stat captures.


9. NON-OFFENSIVE POINTS (Def/ST Scores)
   
   What it measures: Points scored by defense or special teams, including:
   - Pick-sixes
   - Fumble return touchdowns
   - Punt/kick return touchdowns
   - Blocked kick return touchdowns
   - Safeties
   
   How to read it: Higher is better. Most games this is 0-0. When it's not,
   it's often decisive.
   
   Why it matters: A pick-6 is worth ~10+ points of swing (7 points scored plus
   the possession the opponent lost). In the base Turnovers stat, it only shows
   as +1. Non-offensive scores are discrete, high-impact events that need
   separate tracking.


10. POSSESSIONS (Drive Count)
    
    What it measures: Total number of offensive drives for each team.
    
    How to read it: Context-dependent. More possessions means more opportunities,
    but can also indicate quick drives (good if scoring, bad if punting).
    
    Why it matters: Two teams can have identical efficiency, but if one team had
    12 possessions and the other had 9, volume explains the scoring gap. Possession
    count also captures pace of play and time of possession indirectly.


INTERPRETING THE DASHBOARD
--------------------------

Factor Count: The summary shows how many factors each team "won." Winning 5+ of 8
factors almost always correlates with winning the game.

Strength Indicators: The diamond symbols show magnitude of advantage:
- ◆◆◆ Dominant (>30% difference)
- ◆◆ Strong (15-30% difference)
- ◆ Slight (5-15% difference)
- · Minimal (<5% difference)

A team can win fewer factors but still win the game if they dominated the factors
they won (e.g., winning Turnovers +3 matters more than losing Explosiveness by 1%).

When Factors Conflict: If the stats suggest Team A should have won but Team B
actually won, look for:
- Non-offensive points (a pick-6 can overcome losing most factors)
- Finishing drives (getting to the 40 means nothing without points)
- Turnovers in critical field position (not all turnovers are equal)
