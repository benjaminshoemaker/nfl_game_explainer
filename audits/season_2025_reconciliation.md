# Season 2025 Reconciliation Report

## Summary
- Games analyzed: 238
- Mismatch games: 193
- Games with turnover mismatches: 9
- Games with yards mismatches: 192
- Games with penalty-yards mismatches: 0

## Priority Sort
Sorted by `max(|turnovers_delta|) desc`, then `max(|yards_delta|) desc` per game.

## Suggested Reconciliation Work Items (Heuristic)
- Turnover deltas: review turnover classification (muffed kicks, onside recoveries, replay reversals).
- Yards deltas: review how yards are attributed on turnover plays (interceptions/fumbles with returns) vs offensive yards.
- Penalty deltas: review how penalties are attributed (defensive/offensive, accepted vs no-play).
- Excluded plays with non-zero yards can indicate classification mismatches (penalty/no-play, special teams returns).

Heuristic counts across mismatch games:
- Potential missed turnover-keyword plays (not counted by windelta): 318
- Excluded non-zero-yard plays (not counted as offense by windelta): 5041
